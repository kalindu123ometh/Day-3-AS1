    <p style="text-align:left;">Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that combines engineering, computer science, and design to create and utilize machines, called robots, to perform tasks. These robots are designed to replicate, substitute, or assist humans in various roles, including manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, and logistics. 
        robotics, design, construction, and use of machines (robots) to perform tasks done traditionally by human beings. Robots are widely used in such industries as automobile manufacture to perform simple repetitive tasks, and in industries where work must be performed in environments hazardous to humans.

        Scientists often have the feeling that, through their work, they are learning about
some aspect of themselves. Physicists see this connection in their work; so do,
for example, psychologists and chemists. In the study of robotics, the connection
between the field of study and ourselves is unusually obvious. And, unlike a science
that seeks only to analyze, robotics as currently pursued takes the engineering bent
toward synthesis. Perhaps it is for these reasons that the field fascinates so many
of us.
The study of robotics concerns itself with the desire to synthesize some aspects
of human function by the use of mechanisms, sensors, actuators, and computers.
Obviously, this is a huge undertaking, which seems certain to require a multitude of
ideas from various "classical" fields.

        The intersection of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly becoming a driving force in the creation of new industries, cutting-edge technologies and increased productivity and efficiency in existing sectors. As the field of AI in robotics continues to evolve, its applications in the real world are becoming increasingly apparent. 
        From self-driving cars, customer service and healthcare, to industrial and service robots, AI is playing a critical role in transforming industries and improving daily life. Although there have been concerns about the potential of AI and robotics to make some aspects of human work obsolete, the World Economic Forum (WEF) predicts that this technology will create 12 million more jobs than it terminates by 2025. This growth presents an opportunity for the retraining and reskilling of the workforce and investment in knowledge that aligns with the latest technologies.
